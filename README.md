# Writing a tokenizer ? that escapes script tags

There is a easy solution using regex but regex is kinda slow.
So I am trying to write a tokenizer that just replaces the script tags

Currently I have only implemented the regex version and added tests for it.

If you want to add any test cases feel free

Steps to test

```bash
yarn # install dependencies
yarn test
```
